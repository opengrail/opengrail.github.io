# Lubricious productivity

Yes, productivity is a slippery substance.

Much ink has been spilled over it in personal and work spheres.

Famous texts of Highly Effective Snake-Oil Salesmen mix up psychology and personal mythology with some common themes: an emphasis on personal discipline, collaboration and low-tech tools.

And another common theme - zero facts or proof of actual effectiveness other than the success of their author. That success is further bolstered by the popularity of the claptrap they peddle.

# IT is core to big business

Software projects can be expensive so the search is on for techniques that will unlock magic productivity gains.

So, in software, the search for productivity has been a constant. And likewise the facts and proof seem illusory as we zoom out to the highest level.

Like the seven hobbits, a microscopic view can help.

10x developers. Existence (totemic) and criticism (piss factory style).

Form follows function (lovely to bend things around!)

There is an app store category devoted to such TODO list applications and I am happy to be on the other side of that industry, mocking them and the illusions of control that they purport to offer.

In software functions are created using languages and protocols are used to for  interoperability.

When we are walking through the desert and become thirsty we become desperate, even delusional.

We've heard of mortgage driven development, ego driven development and the non-pejorative TDD and BDD

They all sum up to one thing - hope or fear of the future and some prescription to manage it

This is why I prefer the term mirage driven development

Religions do not have proof of all of their claims. Nor do Astro-physicists. But we have existential proof of both religion and physics. They drive devotion and action even if they are sometimes opposed.

Likewise neither static or dynamic types can solve all problems but there is existential prove of their effectiveness to create and run mission critical business processes.

Leaving aside what we cannot prove let's take software like medicine. It's a much better match than building because it accepts that the system is complex and not completely understood. Administering treatment is like building corporate software - unpredictable and may have unwanted side effects. We can't even predict the side effects.

Like medicine we prove effectiveness by experimenting and we are definitely still at the whiskey and leeches stage. We don't know if future generations will discover the equivalent of hand washing (biggest life saver ever) or what the equivalent of a CATSCAN will look like for PLs.

We do know that people crave certainty and leadership and are suckers for a confident huckster such as myself.
