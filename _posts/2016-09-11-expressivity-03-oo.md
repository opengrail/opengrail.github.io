# Expressivity in code
In the [initial post][expressivity] I gave an example of how we see expressivity increase in maths as we progress from words to symbolic arithmetic to algebra 

I introduced a woolly model to test expressivity - does it enable us to say more in our programs and yet remain precise by being open to a transparent and predictable form of substitution?

#Object oriented

Will be here soon after the Class hierarchy that we are working on is in its final state.
