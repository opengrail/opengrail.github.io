I am Ray McDermott, a consultant developing software and helping out on software architectures.

Originally from the UK but living in Belgium for tax reasons. If you're not Belgian you won't realise just how funny that is.

#Feedback

I am thinking about putting comments on here but in the meantime please see me on the Clojurian Slack or tweet me up.

#Past talks:

Here is a [link to a largely extemporaneous talk at JSConf EU][js-conf] about migrating an auto manufacturer's Pan-European web site infrastructure to Node.js and Heroku 

#Future talks:

I am scheduled to talk more about JS at a [reactjs meetup in Brussels 13th January 2016][react-js]

I have submitted a talk to the folks at [Clojure Days in Amsterdam][clojure-days] which runs on Saturday March 19, 2016. 

I will be going to the conference anyway so let me know if you're going too because I love to have conversations about any of this stuff!

#Cycling

If you really want to stalk me you can follow my cycle training for my next attempt at the [legendary Marmotte][marmotte] event in July 2016 on a hand-made, full carbon Twitter account.
